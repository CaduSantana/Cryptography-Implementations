# Cryptography case studies and examples in Python

## The following cryptography methodologies are covered in this repository:
- [x] [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- [x] [Rail Fence Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher)
- [X] [Rotor Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)
## How to run the code
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command in the terminal
```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```
3. The algorithm will read the input from the `plaintext.txt` file and write the output to a file for each algorithm on the same directory.

Do notice that the key for each algorithm is present on the `key.txt` file as a int value. You can change the key to your liking.
